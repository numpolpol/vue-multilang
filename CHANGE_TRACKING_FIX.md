# Change Tracking Fix

## Problem
Change detection was not working because the `snapshotOriginalState()` method was never called after importing files. The system had no baseline to compare against.

## Root Cause
1. **FolderUploader.vue**: After importing files and creating project, missing `snapshotOriginalState()` call
2. **uploadFileToLanguage()**: No snapshot for individual file uploads 
3. **loadProject()**: Already had snapshot call ✅

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Folder Import (FolderUploader.vue)
```typescript
// Sync to legacy structure
filesStore.syncLanguagesToFiles()

// CRITICAL: Snapshot the original state for change tracking
filesStore.snapshotOriginalState() // ← Added this line

success(...)
```

### 2. Fixed Individual File Upload (files.ts)
```typescript
// Sync to legacy structure for compatibility
this.syncLanguagesToFiles()

// Snapshot original state if this is the first file upload
if (this.originalLanguages.length === 0) {  // ← Added this block
  this.snapshotOriginalState()
}
```

## How Change Tracking Works

1. **Import Phase**: Files are loaded → `snapshotOriginalState()` captures baseline
2. **Edit Phase**: User modifies values → changes are tracked against original
3. **Export Phase**: `exportAllColumns()` → shows changes popup with differences

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Import files** → Original state captured  
✅ **Edit values** → Changes detected  
✅ **Delete keys** → Changes detected  
✅ **Add keys** → Changes detected  
✅ **Export All** → Popup shows summary of all changes

## Testing
1. Import .strings files via folder upload
2. Make some edits (change values, delete keys, add keys)  
3. Click "Export All" button
4. Should see popup with detailed change summary
