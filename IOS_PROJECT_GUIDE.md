# Vue Multi-Language Editor - iOS Project Guide

## 📱 Overview

The Vue Multi-Language Editor is a powerful web-based tool designed to streamline the localization process for iOS applications. It provides a centralized platform for managing `.strings` files across multiple languages with advanced features for collaboration, quality assurance, and development efficiency.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For iOS Projects

1. **Export your existing .strings files** from your iOS project
2. **Upload them to the editor** using the drag-and-drop interface
3. **Add team members** to collaborate on translations
4. **Use the advanced editing features** to manage your localizations
5. **Export the updated files** back to your iOS project

### Supported File Formats

- **Primary**: iOS `.strings` files (`"key" = "value";`)
- **Secondary**: Android `.xml` files (for dual-platform projects)
- **Import**: JSON files (automatically flattened)
- **Bulk Import**: TSV files for mass data entry

- **Change Tracking**: Monitor what translators modified
- **Regex Search**: Complex pattern matching for quality checks

### Quality Assurance Checklist
```
✅ All keys have translations in target languages
✅ No duplicate keys exist
✅ Consistent terminology across the app
✅ Text length appropriate for UI constraints
✅ Special characters properly escaped
✅ Placeholder variables maintained (e.g., %@, %d)
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Export current .strings files** from Xcode project
2. **Upload to editor** for translation work
3. **Collaborate with translators** in real-time
4. **Download updated files** with preserved structure
5. **Import back to Xcode** with zero configuration changes

### Key Features for Developers
- **Hover Popup Editing**: Quick value inspection and editing

### Changes Tracking System
- **Original State Snapshot**: Automatically saved when loading projects
- **Real-time Change Detection**: Immediate feedback on modifications
- **Color-coded Indicators**:
  - 🟢 **Green**: New translations added
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Existing translations modified  
  - 🔴 **Red**: Translations removed
- **Detailed Change History**: View old vs new values with timestamps

### Smart Search Capabilities
```
Search Modes:
- empty:           → Find empty/missing values
- duplicate:       → Detect duplicate content
- key:pattern      → Search in keys only
- value:pattern    → Search in values only
- lang:th:pattern  → Search specific language
- /regex/          → Regular expression search
- term1,term2      → Multiple term search
```

### View Modes
- **All Keys**: Show complete translation set
- **Page Sections**: Group by key prefixes (e.g., login_, settings_)
- **Changes Only**: Display modified translations only

## 📋 Best Practices

### For Product Teams
1. **Establish Naming Conventions**: Use consistent key naming (e.g., `screen_element_action`)
2. **Regular Review Cycles**: Schedule periodic translation reviews
3. **Context Documentation**: Provide context for translators in comments
4. **Progressive Localization**: Add languages incrementally based on market priority

### For QA Teams
1. **Pre-translation Audit**: Verify source strings before translation
2. **Completeness Checks**: Ensure 100% translation coverage before release
3. **Consistency Validation**: Check terminology across related keys
4. **UI Testing**: Verify text fits in interface elements

### For Development Teams
1. **Key Organization**: Group related strings with prefixes
2. **Comment Everything**: Add context comments for translators
3. **Placeholder Consistency**: Standardize variable naming (%@, %1$@)
4. **Export Verification**: Test exported files in development environment
